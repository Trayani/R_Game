 
This folder contains text files consisting of:
    start:                 s
    blocked cell:          ■
    free cell:             □
    visible free cell:     o




For each file, ensure a test exists that collects visible cell IDs and check they are consistent with the file

A file can also contain a commentary under the grid representation. This should be ignored for passing tests,
but can help with debugging failing tests.
