 Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the design document and the current implementation. Let me provide a critical evaluation:

  Critical Evaluation of actor_movement_crowd.txt

  I've analyzed your crowd movement design and identified several critical issues and areas for improvement. Here's my honest assessment:

  ---
  Major Design Flaws

  1. Flawed Collision Detection Logic (Lines 14-18)

  Your condition in step 4 has a logical error:

  return next_distance > A.radius + NA.radius || next_distance > current_distance

  Problem: The || (OR) operator is incorrect. This allows movement even when actors would collide, as long as they're getting closer together.

  Example: If next_distance = 0.5, radius_sum = 1.0, but current_distance = 2.0, the condition passes because 0.5 < 2.0, even though the actors would overlap!

  Fix: Should be && (AND):
  next_distance >= A.radius + NA.radius && next_distance >= current_distance

  This ensures both conditions must be true:
  - Actors maintain minimum separation (next_distance >= radius_sum)
  - Movement doesn't make things worse (next_distance >= current_distance)

  2. Inefficient Cell-Based Neighbor Detection (Lines 11-13)

  Your approach:
  "identify all cells that will be occupied on the new position... if cell is already occupied"

  Problems:
  - O(n) search through all actors for every move
  - Misses actors in adjacent cells that are within radius
  - Only checks actors sharing exact cells, not spatial proximity

  Better approach: Use spatial hashing or grid-based spatial partitioning:
  - Divide world into larger "spatial cells" (e.g., 3x3 game cells)
  - Store actor lists per spatial cell
  - Check only actors in current + adjacent spatial cells
  - O(1) average case instead of O(n)

  ---
  3. Arbitrary and Insufficient Angle Selection (Lines 20-22)

  Your alternative positions use fixed angles: ±60°, ±120°, ±175°

  Problems:
  - Why these specific angles? No justification provided
  - Only 6 alternatives - very limited search space
  - No consideration of obstacle geometry - might pick angles that point into walls
  - Fixed order - always tries same angles, leading to predictable bunching

  Better approach:
  - Dynamic angle generation based on:
    - Direction to nearby obstacles (raycasting-aware)
    - Direction away from nearby actors (repulsion vector)
    - Tangent angles to obstacles (sliding behavior)
  - Adaptive search - try more angles if initial attempts fail
  - Randomization - add small random perturbations to avoid symmetrical bunching

  4. Missing Critical Edge Cases

  Undefined behaviors:
  - What if actor is ALREADY too close? (current_distance < radius_sum)
    - Your condition allows movement as long as next_distance > current_distance
    - But actors could remain perpetually overlapped
  - What if multiple actors pick the same alternative position?
    - No coordination mechanism mentioned
    - Could lead to oscillation or permanent blocking
  - What happens when actor "has to wait"? (Line 8)
    - How long does it wait?
    - Does it re-evaluate every frame?
    - Could lead to deadlocks with actors waiting for each other

  5. Performance Concerns

  Per-frame costs for each actor:
  1. Calculate next position
  2. Find all cells occupied (up to 4 cells)
  3. Search all actors in those cells (potentially O(n))
  4. Calculate euclidean distance to each
  5. If blocked, try 6 alternative positions (each repeating steps 1-4)

  Worst case: O(actors * nearby_actors * 7_attempts) = O(n²) per frame

  For 100 actors in a crowded area, this could be 10,000+ distance calculations per frame.

  ---
  Missing Design Elements

  1. No Radius Specification

  "Each actor will have its own radius value. This should be a relatively small float number"

  Missing:
  - What's a typical radius value? (0.1? 0.5? 5.0?)
  - How does it relate to cell size?
  - Should it be configurable per actor type, or global?
  - What's the maximum allowed radius?

  2. No Priority System

  When actors conflict, who goes first?
  - First-come-first-served?
  - Random?
  - Priority based on actor ID, speed, or distance to goal?

  Without this, you'll get non-deterministic behavior where replay doesn't work.

  3. No Temporal Coherence

  Actors make completely independent decisions each frame. Better approach:
  - Velocity smoothing - remember previous movement direction
  - Commitment period - stick with chosen alternative for N frames
  - Predictive avoidance - consider other actors' velocities, not just positions

  4. No Force-Based Alternative

  Your approach is discrete validation (yes/no for each position).

  Consider continuous forces instead:
  - Separation force: Push away from nearby actors
  - Alignment force: Match speed with neighbors
  - Cohesion force: Stay with group
  - Goal force: Move toward destination

  This is the Boids/Reynolds flocking model - proven, smooth, emergent behavior.

  Recommended Design Improvements

  Option A: Fix Current Design (Minimal Changes)

  1. Fix the collision condition (AND instead of OR)
  2. Add spatial partitioning for neighbor detection
  3. Improve angle selection:
  - Calculate repulsion vector from nearby actors
  - Generate 8-12 angles in an arc away from congestion
  - Weight angles by distance to obstacles (using raycasting)
  - Add small random variation
  4. Define waiting behavior:
  - If all positions fail, actor velocity *= 0.9 (slow down)
  - After N frames of slowdown, try alternative paths
  - After M frames, request new pathfinding

  Option B: Hybrid Force-Based Approach

  1. Keep pathfinding for long-range navigation
  2. Use local force-based steering within radius R of other actors:
  fn calculate_steering_force(&self, nearby_actors: &[Actor]) -> (f32, f32) {
      let separation = calculate_separation_force(nearby_actors);
      let goal = calculate_goal_force(self.path_direction);
      let obstacle_avoidance = calculate_obstacle_force(grid, raycast);

      combine_forces(separation * 2.0, goal * 1.0, obstacle_avoidance * 3.0)
  }
  3. Forces naturally handle crowds - no special cases needed

  Specific Line-by-Line Issues

  Line 2: "se the movement feels natural"
  - Typo: "se" → "so"

  Line 10: "actor A is steps into new float position"
  - Grammar: "is steps" → "steps"

  Line 17: The formula is unclear:
  next_distance = $ euclidean distance between next_position and NA $
  Should specify: sqrt((next_x - NA.x)² + (next_y - NA.y)²)

  Line 22: "the distance to the destination must not increase"
  - This contradicts the alternative angles!
  - ±120° and ±175° angles will almost always increase distance to destination
  - Do you mean "shouldn't increase much"? Define threshold.

←  ☐ Overlap logi  ☐ Blocking  ☐ Performance  ☐ Determinism  ✔ Submit  →

Should actors be able to push through crowds if they're moving apart (current_distance < next_distance), even if they'd temporarily overlap?
❯ 1. Yes, allow pushing through if separating
     More dynamic movement, but actors can momentarily overlap. Uses your original OR condition.
  2. No, strict separation always
     Actors never overlap, but may get stuck more often. Uses AND condition.
  3. Type something.
