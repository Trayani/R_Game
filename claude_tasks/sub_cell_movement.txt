each sub-cell can be occupied by one actor exactly.
To move another to sub-cell, the actor has to reserve it for himself!
So in a transition phase, two sub-cells are reserved.
Once the actor gets closer to the reserved cell, release the current cell and continue to center of the reserved cell

```
IF distance_to_reserved_cell <= distance_to_current_cell {
    release(current_cell)
    current_cell = reserved_cell
    go_to_current_cell_center()
}
```

When actor aligns to the sub-cell center, look for another sub-cell.
From one sub-cell, it is possible to reserve one of 8 neighbouring cells (8 possible directions .. 2 vertical,2 horizontal and 4 diagonal)
The best sub-cell is the one that best aligns with direction toward the destination.
But if the sub-cell is reserved, check 4 other sub-cells that best align with the destination.

```
define cell_reservation_passed(cell) {
    if (cell.is_reserved)
        return false
    reserved_cell = next_cell
    cell.is_reserved = true
    return true
}

IF current_center_reached && !destination_not_reached:
    if (
        cell_reservation_passed(next_cell)
        ||   cell_reservation_passed(next_cell.clockwise_neighbour())
        ||   cell_reservation_passed(next_cell.counter_clockwise_neighbour())
        ||   cell_reservation_passed(next_cell.clockwise_neighbour().clockwise_neighbour())
        ||   cell_reservation_passed(next_cell.counter_clockwise_neighbour().counter_clockwise_neighbour())
    ) {
        proceed_to_reserved_cell()
    } else {
        wait_for_clear_path()
    }
```
