ACTOR
is a dynamic element in the grid
- can be placed on one cell cleanly or messily on 2 or 4 cells at once!
- has his own square bounds in floating point dimensions. Precise location of bounds determine
- if the actor is placed cleanly or messily
-- all actor square edges in one cell -> clean position
-- edges span two cells in horizontally -> messy X
-- edges span two cells in vertically  -> messy Y
-- edges span two cell both H and V -> messy X & Y

- ACTOR can move!
-- movement is precise. Actor can move in any direction just by a few floating points his grid


Actor properties:
@ SIZE : floating point size of the actor's square area. SIZE must always be equal or lesser than grid cell size
@ FLOAT POSITION ("float pos" / "fpos"): is a (float  x,float y) tuple of floating-point-precise position of the actor.
This is the actor's square area center. Square edges are calculated by -+ SIZE/2  from the fpos.
@ CELL POSITION ("cell pos" / cpos): is a state that describes on what cell is actor placed and if it is messy on X/Y.
The cell is determined by the TOP-LEFT point of actor's square.
Messiness by the position of a the DOWN-RIGHT point:
-- messyX = topLeftCell.X <> dwnRightCell.X
-- messyY =  topLeftCell.Y <> dwnRightCell.Y
@ SPEED - a floating point value that roughly describes number of pixels the actor can travel
@ DEST - cpos of a position the actor is traveling to

Upon every change of position,

- GUI:
- key O: set actor at the mouse position (fpos exactly at mouse position)
- key P: set actor's destination
- 60 frame-per-second: make the actor move a bit towards the destination
